## 1. Complete Pipeline for Multiclass PCA+SVD based Model for Clinical Dementia Rating Prediction

File 'Multiclass-Prediction-Model-LASI-DAD' contains the entire pipeline for Machine Learning prediction model for classifying 5 CDR scores. This includes data preprocessing and cleaning, data visualisation and transformation using T-SNE, PCA, Histogram, training PCA+SVM based multiclass model, and detailed evaluation of this model. Average accuracy of CDR prediction on unseen testing data using this model is 95.72%

## 2. NN Model for using (sub)feature set to predict dementia onset

Implementation of 2 layer model done in Pytorch. Data input and vectorisation needs completing. NN tried due to wide dataset, but issues on vectorisation due to unusual encoding of the features that needs to be examined

## 3. A Systematic Literature Review on "Dementia" and "LASI-DAD" through Scopus Database along with Twitter Analytics for feature enahancement of ML-based model

184 final stage journal articles identified out of more than 2 lakh total documents in the repository with major focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Forecasting, Convolution Neural Network based techniques for Dementia Prediction. Also, there are total of 10 published papers on LASI-DAD on Scopus till date. Further, aprroximately 65K recent tweets through Twitter API are extracted and aanlysed to understand the discussions surrounding "Dementia" on Social Media.

## 4. Multiview analysis of Cognitive features with demographics, health and pollution features

The notebook 'PLS_analysis.ipynb' contains a partial least squares (PLS) analysis considering a subset of the LASI-DAD data as two data views: a cognitive dataset, and a health, demographics and pollution dataset. We explore the associative effect between these two data views and provide an analysis of feature importance. We show that by viewing the dataset in this way, we find PLS projections that generalise to test data and reflect disease severity. This initial exploration of PLS could be extended in future work. For example, using the PLS components rather than PCA components as input for the classification model discussed in 1).
